    "# Problem Statement 1:\n",
    "# Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. \n",
    "# A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on blood glucose levels. \n",
    "# A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet have a mean glucose level of 108. \n",
    "# Test the hypothesis that the raw cornstarch had an effect or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "Step 1: State Null Hypothesis Ho: μ = 100\n",
    "Step 2: State Alternate Hypothesis H1: μ ≠ 100\n",
    "Step 3: State your alpha level. We’ll use 0.05 for this example. As this is a one-tailed test, 0.05 (Due to only positive effect)\n",
    "Step 4: Find the z-score associated with your alpha level. You’re looking for the area in one tail only. An area of .05 for 45% which is equal to a z-score of 1.645.\n",
    "Step 5: Find the test statistic using this formula: z score formula\n",
    "z=(108-100)/(15/√36)=8/15/6= 48/15 = 16/5 = 3.2\n",
    "Step 6: If Step 5 is greater than 1.645 (Step 3), reject the null hypothesis. In this case,In this case, it is greater (3.2>1.645), so you can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "So, we can conclude that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect in blood glucose levels.\n"
